# Design

### Overview

We are building a modular, async-first database foundation centered on a transactional store abstraction. The core contract is a base `BTree` store that exposes ordered key/value reads directly and requires all mutation activity to occur through a transaction object.

- `BTree<K, V>` is the base store trait for ordered lookup and range queries.
- `BTreeTransaction<K, V>` is the write-bound object used for inserts, deletes, range scans, and atomic commit/rollback.
- `TableBTree` and `IndexBTree` are higher-level adapters that use transactions to update rows and indexes together.

This approach makes it possible to coordinate row and index changes in one atomic unit while keeping direct reads lightweight.

### Goals

- Center the design on a single transactional store trait.
- Make mutation semantics explicit: all writes must use a transaction object.
- Support pluggable async backends for both tables/indexes and durable storage.
- Keep adapter logic backend-agnostic and async-compatible.
- Allow the same adapter code to work over memory or durable store implementations.
- Enable batched multi-row updates via transaction objects in higher-level APIs.

### Key Concepts

- **Transactional Store**: A shared async map trait that can create a transaction object for mutations.
- **Transaction Object**: The only mutation path for inserts, removes, and commit/rollback.
- **TableBTree**: A table-oriented adapter that uses a transaction to update row data and supporting indexes together.
- **IndexBTree**: An index-oriented adapter that updates tuple-to-record mappings through transactions.
- **Backend swap**: Any semantic adapter can be backed by any compatible transactional B-tree store.

### Core Store Abstraction

The central contract is a generic `BTree<K, V>` trait describing an async ordered map with transaction creation.

A core store implementation should provide:

- async `get(key) -> Option<value>`
- async `range(range) -> Stream<(key, value)>`
- async `begin_transaction() -> Transaction`

Mutation operations are not provided directly on `BTree`. They are available only through the transaction object returned by `begin_transaction()`.

Example API:

```rust
pub trait BTree<K, V>: Send + Sync {
    type Transaction<'a>: BTreeTransaction<K, V> + Send + 'a where Self: 'a;

    fn get<'a, Q>(&'a self, key: &'a Q) -> Self::GetFuture<'a, Q>
    where
        K: Borrow<Q> + Ord,
        Q: Ord + ?Sized + Sync;

    fn range<'a, T, R>(&'a self, range: R) -> Self::RangeStream<'a, T, R>
    where
        T: Ord + ?Sized + Send,
        K: Borrow<T> + Ord,
        R: RangeBounds<T> + Send;

    fn begin_transaction<'a>(&'a self) -> Self::BeginTransactionFuture<'a>;
}
```

### Transaction Abstraction

A transaction object is the only permitted mutation entrypoint. It should support:

- `get(key) -> Option<value>`
- `insert(key, value) -> Result<(), StoreError>`
- `remove(key) -> Option<value>`
- `range(range) -> Stream<(key, value)>`
- `commit() -> Result<(), StoreError>`
- `rollback() -> Result<(), StoreError>`

That enables higher-level adapters to:

- update a row and its indexes in the same transaction,
- batch multiple changes across rows before committing,
- coordinate table and index changes atomically.

### Adapter Specializations

Adapters are semantic layers built on top of the transactional store API.

#### TableBTree

`TableBTree` is a table/document adapter that uses a transactional `BTree` store.

Responsibilities:

- store records by a primary key or document identifier
- read records with `get` and `scan`
- perform all writes through a `BTreeTransaction`
- update supporting index state within the same transaction

Example semantics:

- key: document ID
- value: serialized row or document bytes

#### IndexBTree

`IndexBTree` is an index adapter that also uses transactions for write semantics.

Responsibilities:

- map index keys to record identifiers
- support index insert/delete semantics
- perform writes through a `BTreeTransaction`
- allow combined table/index changes to be grouped in one transaction

Example semantics:

- key: index tuple
- value: record ID or list of record IDs

### Persistent Stores

Persistent stores implement the transactional store API for raw bytes.

Responsibilities:

- handle raw byte key/value semantics
- expose the same async read contract as the core store
- support transaction creation, commit, and rollback
- serve as durable backing for higher-level adapters

### Adapter and Store Interactions

Adapters and stores share a single transactional interface.

- `BTree` is the base store trait.
- `BTreeTransaction` is the mutation object returned by the store.
- `TableBTree` and `IndexBTree` are semantic adapters that never mutate outside a transaction.
- Higher-level APIs can create a transaction, apply multiple row and index updates, and commit atomically.

### Implementation Scope

This document is a blueprint for the core transactional store API and its first adapter model. Detailed storage formats, locking, and query planning remain out of scope.

Next step: implement `BTree` and `BTreeTransaction` in `crates/db-core`, then add semantic adapter traits and supporting store implementations.

### Engine Query Layer (db-engine)

The `db-engine` crate provides a small, programmatic relational query layer on top of the table/index adapters. It is intentionally narrow: a correctness-first executor that makes it easy to run multi-table queries without a full SQL parser or optimizer.

- Public API: an enum-based programmatic API (`EngineQuery`) with a unified `Select` variant that accepts qualified projections (`table` + `column_index`), join clauses, aggregates, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` options.
- Join support: inner, left, right, and full joins are supported. Multiple joins are executed left-deep in the order they are provided.
- Execution model: a left-deep, nested-loop executor implemented in `EngineKernel::read_extended`.
  - The executor collects rows for referenced tables (via transactional scans) and composes partial row maps during join processing.
  - Outer joins use null-extension semantics: when a row has no matching counterpart, the missing side's projected columns yield `NULL`.
- Aggregation: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVG` are supported. `COUNT(None)` represents `COUNT(*)`. Aggregates are computed per-group by maintaining per-group aggregator state during execution.
- Ordering & limits: `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` are supported. For grouped queries, `ORDER BY` currently supports ordering by group keys or aggregate outputs.

### Index Use and Performance

- Single-table selects continue to use index-assisted lookups when a matching index exists for the predicate.
- Join execution currently uses nested-loop semantics. Index-assisted join lookup (probe the right side using an index keyed by the join expression) is not implemented in the MVP but is planned as an optimization.
- The current executor prioritizes correctness and clear semantics over performance. For large datasets, nested-loop join behavior may be slow; future improvements include join reordering, index probes, and streaming execution.

### Semantics & Limitations

- Not a SQL engine: there is no SQL parser or planner in this crate. The API is programmatic and intentionally explicit.
- Not feature-complete: HAVING, DISTINCT, window functions, subqueries, and complex expression planning are out of scope for the initial implementation.
- Single-threaded executor: the current implementation performs execution in-process and is not parallelized.

### Tests

The engine layer includes unit tests that exercise the new features and verify semantics. See `crates/db-engine/src/engine.rs` for tests such as:

- `inner_join_simple`
- `left_join_simple`
- `right_join_simple`
- `full_join_simple`
- `multiple_joins_chain`
- `group_by_count_and_sum`
- `order_by_and_limit`

### Future Work (query layer)

- Add index-assisted join probes and simple cost heuristics for join ordering.
- Implement a lightweight logical plan representation to enable filter/aggregate pushdown and join reordering.
- Add streaming execution to avoid collecting entire tables into memory.
- Expand expression support and add a SQL front-end if desired.
